# 🚴 Dublin Bikes Data Presentation Web Application

> Developed as part of the **COMP30830 Software Engineering** coursework at University College Dublin, this project provides real-time data and predictive insights for Dublin's bike-sharing system. The application allows users to view bike availability, plan routes, and make informed decisions using machine learning predictions.



## 📋 Project Overview

The **Dublin Bikes Web Application** addresses urban mobility challenges by helping users locate available bikes and bike stands in real-time. It includes features such as:
- **Real-time Bike Availability**: Access to live data on bike availability at stations.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Displays areas with high bike density.
- **Journey Planning**: Route planning from start to destination stations.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning-powered predictions on future bike availability.
